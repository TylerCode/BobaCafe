# BobaCafe

Blame AGrrrlHasNoName, boba tea for all!

It's open source but there are much better projects to contribute to and learn from. I can promise you that. Mizu's Flowers and Artisan Valley are great examples and much can be gleaned by digging around in those files. 

Was originally going to be an SMAPI mod by itself but JsonAssets just works so freaking well. So that's where it stands until it NEEDS something heavier.
