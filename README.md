# BobaCafe

A boba tea mod for StarDew Valley. Credit to AGrrrlHasNoName for Idea and Art.

2024 Update: This still works in the current 1.5 version of the game. If anything breaks in 1.6 it will be updated.

## Devs and Potential Contributors!

It's open source but there are much better projects to contribute to and learn from. I can promise you that. Take a look at the Project Populate for a good example. I am accepting pull requests for translations and compatibility fixes though so feel free to give it a go.

Was originally going to be an SMAPI mod by itself but JsonAssets just works so freaking well. So that's where it stands until it NEEDS something heavier.

## Installation

Download BobaCafe.zip, extract it and copy the "BobaCafe" folder into your Stardew Valley/Mods folder. Then in Year 2 you will start getting recipes from Caroline. 

This mod depends on these other mods:
- ExpandedPreconditionsUtility
- JsonAssets
- MailFrameworkMod
- SpaceCore

This mod is compatible or integrates with these mods: 
- PPJA Fruits and Veggies (Cassava)
- Artisan Valley (Tapioca)
- PPJA More Recipes (Boba Tea)
- More coming soon...
