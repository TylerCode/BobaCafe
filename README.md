# BobaCafe

A boba tea mod for StarDew Valley. Credit to AGrrrlHasNoName for Idea and Art.

It's open source but there are much better projects to contribute to and learn from. I can promise you that. Take a look at the Project Populate for a good example. I am accepting pull requests for translations though so feel free to give it a go.

Was originally going to be an SMAPI mod by itself but JsonAssets just works so freaking well. So that's where it stands until it NEEDS something heavier.

## Installation
